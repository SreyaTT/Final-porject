Reflection
In this project, I encountered using ren'py in the beginning, but overcame them by watching lots and lots of tutorials. Overall, I learned the basics of how to use ren'py and I will continue to use it. Probably also try to make this project even better by inclcuing videos and more labels to make it more interesting!


I hope that my project amuses, amazes, or makes a positive impact on the world in some way. Thank you for your consideration!
